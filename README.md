# odin-recipes
Making my first project for The Odin Project which is a recipe page.

I already had knowledge of html and this project helped me to become comfortable with git. Like learning the syntax for the commands and what each one this. This also helped me to create better commit messages and become more comfortable with creatin folders for projects. I'm also becoming more comfortable with using linux overall.
